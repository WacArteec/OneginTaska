     Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila, 

     in Adam Smith was his diploma; 

     it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abbé. 

     and telling trochee from iambic 

     He was without that dithyrambic 

     that world where every man's a critic 

     boo Phaedra out as paralytic, 

     of entertaining the half-dead: 

     one smoothes the pillows down in bed, 

     My goddesses! Where are you banished? 

     have other maidens, since you vanished, 

     His hair was fashionably curled, 

     reader, or where you've shone and glittered! 

     Onegin, my good friend, was littered 

     far, far from Italy, his adored. 

     deep in Moldavia the abhorred, 

     Unforced, as conversation passed, 

     his bow was wholly unaffected. 

     In French Onegin had perfected 

     stumblingly call to mind he did 

     two verses of the Aeneid. 

     from her Monsieur took on the child. 

     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild. 

     and now at last he saw the World. 

     and took a mortgage on his land. 

     His father failed to understand 

     But you, blest husbands, to the end 

     you kept your friendship with our friend: 

     pursue his love -- and at one bound 

     was quite beyond his wit, we found. 

     frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound, 

     and listen for the heart's first sound, 

     which Ovid sang, for which the bard, 

     condemned to a lifetime of hard, 

     Eugene attends the boulevard, 

     he'd pop the poison in his chalice! 

     what traps he'd set him, with what malice 

     encore Moëna,7 -- and rejoice 

     to know the audience hears his voice. 

     always contented with his life, 

     and with his dinner, and his wife. 

     as I recall a bygone age? 

     Faublas'3 disciple for an age -- 

     as was the old suspicious sage, 

     and yawn in silence at the stage 

     Evgeny's total store of knowledge 

     where he was master of his college, 

     with this the hero of my tale: 

     When out to burst a rival's bubble, 

     of jealousy, to seem to tremble 

     How early he'd learnt to dissemble, 

     How early on he learnt to trouble 

     But God, how deadly dull to sample 

     Let others learn from his example! 

     and glumly serves the medicine bottle, 

     And the sly baseness, fit to throttle, 

     to do them all is easy game. 

     In languid silence, or the flame 

     of eloquence, and just the same 

     Which one comes first? It's just the same 

     felicitously every theme, 

     of listening like a judge-supreme 

     until Bréguet's unsleeping chime 

     that stretched from Romulus in his prime 

     across the years to our own time. 

     advises him of dinner-time. 

     that king of the satiric scene, 

     youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine: 

     for unmeant kindness -- how he shone! 

     taken your place, though not your throne? 

     lend ears to my lugubrious tone: 

     Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre, 

     how bold or bashful there, and here 

     with young Semyónova,9 and there 

     have each asked him to a soirée: 

     impart such lessons as you please! 

     then afterwards, alone, at ease, 

     sits with Limburg's vivacious cheese 

     or, with an epigram-surprise, 

     proficiency to speak and write, 

     promptly had nothing left to give. 

     had only debts on which to live. 

     yet, truthfully and not in chaff, 

     who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff 

     at Cleopatra, hiss her off, 

     He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading: 

     his collar in its beaver braiding 

     tribute of tears, applause's shrilling, 

     there сzerov8 shared the unwilling 

     and there at large he goes patrolling 

     Meanwhile, attired for morning strolling 

     it's easy, without too much fooling, 

     We all meandered through our schooling 

     More wine, he calls, to drench the flaming 

     when Bréguet's chime is heard proclaiming 

     He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating 

     that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting; 

     he had the talent of saluting 

     while serious topics were disputing, 

     and sighs, and asks oneself all through: 

     the meaning of an epigraph, 

     There once I too strolled back and forth: 

     but I'm allergic to the North...1

     and never played a shrewder trick. 

     but when past joking he fell sick, 

     where you were born as well, I think, 

     and bred upon the Neva's brink, 

     a mild rebuke was his worst mark, 

     and then a stroll in Letny Park. 

     the subtle spouse was just as loyal -- 

     and the majestic, antlered royal, 

     let me acquaint you on the nail 

     I have no leisure to recall; 

     the art he'd studied best of all, 

     he really forced one to admire him -- 
``My uncle -- high ideals inspire him; 

     and truffles, which have ever been 

     with comedies of swarm and din; 

     there caustic Shakhovskóy8 came in 

     and the derivative Knyazhnín:8 

     swaying the artless, waiting on 

     of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion, 

     ended his wild career of fashion 

     Fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion, 

     Enchanted land! There like a lampion 

     But when the hour of youthful passion 

     this was the science of that passion 

     in casual letters of confession -- 

     secure a secret assignation, 

     then he'd implore a declaration, 

     He lacked the slightest predilection 

     but groomed an anecdote-collection 

     How soft his glance, or at discretion 

     Fate saved Evgeny from perdition: 

     at first Madame gave him tuition, 

     my disillusioned glass, and yearn, 

     that alien scene must I now turn 

     or pine, persuade of yes or no, 

     wine of the Comet6 fills the cup; 

     he arrives -- the cork goes flying up, 

     our friend Katénin8 brought to bear 

     how brilliant with its instant tear! 

     complete with broad-brimmed bolivar, 

     After a fine career, his father 

     He gave three balls a year, and rather 

     No moralizing from this joker; 

     without preliminary feeler 

     He cursed Theocritus and Homer, 

     Eugene was free, and as a dresser 

     make Juvenal his text, or better 

     add vale when he signed a letter; 

     Russia's Terpsichore, shall never 

     your chorus, is it dead for ever? 

     made London's dandy his professor. 

     He's off -- this ruthless legislator 

     for the footlights, this fickle traitor 

     Now Latin's gone quite out of favour; 

     Onegin knew enough to savour 

     to all the most adored actrices, 

     and ananas, the gold of trees. 

     frightening with all despair's disguises, 

     this denizen of the coulisses 

     What? Invitations? Yes, three houses 

     Some days he's still in bed, and drowses, 

     of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes. 

     How well he donned new shapes and sizes -- 

     haphazard; so, to God be thanks, 

     to pass for cultured in our ranks. 

     the legatee of his relations -- 

     Such were a young rake's meditations -- 

     what occupied his chafing powers 

     throughout the boredom of the hours -- 

     with passion and with shrewd obliqueness 

     stalking the momentary weakness, 

     and act the humble or imperious, 

     the indifferent, or the deadly serious! 

     the new ballet he should be at. 

     The World found this enough to treat 

     fire of the cutlets' scalding fat, 

     the gift of recognizing what 

     Eugene as clever, and quite sweet. 

     shall my sad gaze no more alight 

     again I see your soulful flight? 

     in the mazurka he was light, 

     of simple product supplements it. 

     a nation's wealth is, what augments it, 

     its work, its torture, its enjoyment, 

     his young heyday's supreme employment, 

     that's where my years of youth were spent. 

     there, where the coulisse entrance went, 

     our deep economist had got 

     one thing inspired his breath, his heart, 

     and self-oblivion was his art! 

     the heart of the professional flirt! 

     how well he knew the way to hurt -- 

     as well-read, though of pedant cast. 

     amusing, flattering with the best, 

     startling the ingenuous with a jest, 

     for raking up historic dust 

     as horses whirled him through the dust. 

     by will of Zeus, the high and just, 

     or stirring annalistic must; 

     glitters with hoar-frost all about. 

     ``Make way, make way,'' goes up the shout; 

     "When will the devil come for you?"''

     sickroom attendance night and day 

     struck for Evgeny, with its play 

     when little notes come on a tray. 

     and never stir a foot away! 

     and how a country lives, and why 

     it needs no gold if a supply 

     Onegin was assessed by many 

     (critical judges, strict as any) 

     reluctant to exhaust the boy, 

     treated his lessons as a ploy. 

     on features known, but to that dreary, 

     bored with hilarity, and weary, 

     before him roast beef, red and gory, 

     there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory: 

     and pâté, Strasbourg's deathless glory, 

     once more Corneille's majestic story; 

     where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty? 

     a ball here, there a children's party;
